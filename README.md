# Bytnerowicz-Funk-Menge-Perakis-Wolf-Fixer-Leaf-Traits

R scripts and data to recreate analyses and figures for: 

Bytnerowicz et al. "Nitrogen-fixing trees are not different than non-fixing trees in how photosynthesis and water use efficiency scale with leaf nitrogen, but they have more nitrogen"

There are two R scripts:

The first recreates the analyses and figures for the Main Text: MainText_Analysis_Figures.R

The second recreates the analyses and figures for the Supplement: Supplement_Analysis_Figures.R

There are three .csv files of data:

The first is the data from our field fertilization experiment: Bytnerowicz_etal_Asat_WUE_Nfix_data.csv

The second and third are data from Adams et al. (2016) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: Adams_paired_WUE.csv and Adams_paired_d13C.csv

The Adams et al. data were not publicly available from PNAS and were provided to us by request from Mark Adams. 

We include them here as an analysis of some of these data (those from Figure 3 in Adams et al.) underlie some of our results.
