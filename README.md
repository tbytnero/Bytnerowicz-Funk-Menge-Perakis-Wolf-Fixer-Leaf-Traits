# Bytnerowicz-Funk-Menge-Perakis-Wolf-Fixer-Leaf-Traits

R scripts and data to recreate analyses and figures for: 

Bytnerowicz et al. "Leaf nitrogen affects photosynthesis and water use efficiency similarly in nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing trees"

There is one R script.

The R script recreates the analyses and figures for the main text and for the supplement.

There are three .csv files of data:

The first is the data from our field fertilization experiment: Bytnerowicz_etal_Asat_WUE_Nfix_data.csv

The second and third are data from Adams et al. (2016) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: Adams_paired_WUE.csv and Adams_paired_d13C.csv

The Adams et al. data were not publicly available from PNAS and were provided to us by request from Mark Adams. 

We include them here as an analysis of some of these data (those from Figure 3 in Adams et al.) underlie some of our results.
